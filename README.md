This is a one page web application that fetches information from an API and uses it to fill in the HTML page.
The purpose of this application is simply to display information on player character classes that are in the D&D TTRPG game.

Select a class from the dropdown box and once selected the information on the page changes to show what the selected class and abilities are at each level.

The image that appears in the center of the screen is an example of a level 1 adventurer. It is also a link that will change the page to dark mode as well as change the picture to one that represents a level 20 character of the same class.
